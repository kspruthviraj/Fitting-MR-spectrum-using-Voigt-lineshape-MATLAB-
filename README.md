# Finding-the-linewidth-of-MR-spectrum-using-Voigt-lineshape-MATLAB-

This is a custom written MATLAB script that fits the spectrum using Voigt lineshape.

*NOTE: Some people asked me that the attached script doesnot open up the GUI. But, please note that the attached scripts are only to fit the Voigt lineshape and not to open the GUI and process the spectra as shown in GIF below.*


This is a part of the toolbox that was used to predict the CRLB (Cramer-Rao error percentage) error using water signal. The published paper is here: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.26389
